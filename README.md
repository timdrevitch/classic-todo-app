🔸 **Description:**
This is an application created to show my ability to put together a front-to-back full stack application using the MERN development stack.
In the app, users can perform all 4 typical CRUD opperations. They can create todos, read all active todos, update todos to be complete, and delete todos.

🔸 **Stack:**
This application is using the MERN development stack. For the frontend/client, I am using
React⚛️ along with several other dependencies including Axios🅰, React Icons⚛️, React Oauth/Google🅶,
and Styled Components💅. For the backend/server, I am using NodeJS🅝 along with several other
dependencies including ExpressJS🅔, Cors〄, Dotenv🔐, Nodemon☿, Concurrently⇶, and Mongoose🌱. The app
is being hosted by Heroku♊️ and the database is located on MongoDB Atlas🌱.

🔸 **Development & Testing:**
To run this code in development mode locally (assuming you have already pulled the repository), 'cd' into the root folder and run 'npm install'. Next, 'cd' into the 'client' folder and run 'npm install' again. Lastly, return to the root folder and run 'npm run dev'. These steps need to be done in order to install all of the required dependencies from both package.json files.

🔸 **User Permissions:**
This application does not contain any specific user permissions. Anyone who uses the app will have full capabilities.
